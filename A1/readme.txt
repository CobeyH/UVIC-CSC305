All required elements have been completed without exceptions. The provided checklist has been included with brief details about each element.

1) You have to use real-time to synchronize your animations. (COMPLETED).
 - Real time animation is implemented for the fish displacement, tail rotation, seaweed rotation and diver movement
2) Ground box (COMPLETED).
 - Ground box lays at the bottom of the screen and is a different colour from the sea
3) Two rocks (spheres), (COMPLETED).
 - Two grey rocks are located at the bottom of the seaweed.
4) Seaweed modelling: each strand has 10 ellipses. (COMPLETED).
 - Seaweed strands each have 10 ellipses (I'll be really embarrassed if I mess that up)
5) Seaweed animation (COMPLETED).
 - Seaweed sways back and forth similar to the provided animation. Each segment uses a delayed cosine rotation
6) Seaweed positioning (3 strands) (COMPLETED).
 - Seaweed strands are located on top of, to the left of, and to the right of the large rock as done in the demo video.
7) Fish modelling: 2 eyes with pupils, 1 head, 1 body, 2 tail fins, (COMPLETED).
 - All body parts or present
8) Fish animation: The fish must swim in a circle around the seaweed. It should always be aligned with the tangent of the circle. (COMPLETED).
 - The fish swims in a circle around the seaweed while bobbing up and down. The connecting point between the fish body and head aligns with the tangent of the circle.
9) Model a human character with no arms. (COMPLETE).
 - Disfigured diver without arms has been created with a head, body, two calfs, two thighs and two feet.
10) The character should move in the x and y world directions. (COMPLETED).
 - Character moves up/down in the Y-axis as well as side to side in the X-axis
11) The legs of the character should kick (hips, knees) as shown in the video. Note, the feet do not move. (COMPLETED).
 - Hips and knees rotate independently but the feet do not rotate.
12) You do not have to match the exact motion or dimensions of the objects shown in the examples. However, your scene should fit in the window (see 14) and be qualitatively and visually similar to the sample (COMPLETED).
 - Scene looks visually similar. Colours and exact size may not be perfect but it's pretty close.
13) Programming style (comments, functions) (COMPLETED).
 - Code has been abstracted into function that create each component of the scene. This makes it simple to track the model stack as the code progresses. Functions and complicated code has been commented.
